So my MTAG is set in space, with you as the captain of a traveling ship. The main gameplay is the player experiencing random events in order to gain credits and buy items from the shop. There is still things to be added on, but the game is playable.<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPakc6lJM3O3OotibQzJ7aEbr5eaWRnm0_2WsurOgrOfxw6g/viewform?usp=sf_link">Survey Link</a>
