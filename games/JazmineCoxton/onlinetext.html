My MTAG game is called: Beach House Mysteries. It starts off as a simple meeting with some old friends, and then a friend of yours gets murdered. You meet up with some friends to try to escape and find the murderer. It depends on your choices to find the killer.<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/ohGPm48PxAtgkLpt1" target="_blank">Survey Link</a>
