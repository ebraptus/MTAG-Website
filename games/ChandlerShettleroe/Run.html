			<h1>The Invasion You Could Never See Coming</h1>
		</header>
	<main>
	<p><b>As you look towards Elizabeth, you don't see the young girl that was their before. Instead, you see a robotic figure and nearly yell out loud. You control yourself and decide that you should try to get away. "Hey, Elizabeth? You know what I'm really not that hungry right now, I think I am just going to leave." You say, trying to sound calm.  "What's up all of a sudden with you? I thought you were?" She says jokingly as she turns towards you. "Where did you get those glasses?" She says in a hostile voice. "Uhm someone gave them to me at school today." You say back. "Give me them." She says in a total robotic voice. "Uhm, I don't want to fight but something tells me I shouldn't give you the glasses" You retort. "Fine, then I will just have to take them." She says as she stomps towards you.
