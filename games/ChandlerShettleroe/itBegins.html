			<h1>The Invasion You Could Never See Coming</h1>

	<main>
	<p><b>Finally! That day seemed go on forever. All I could think about is hanging out with Elizabeth and thinking about what that guy said, what weird things was he talking about? I don't know, anyway I need to start heading to Elizabeth's if I want to be on time. You text your mom how your day went and that you are heading to a new friend's house and won't be home till later in the evening. You got Elizabeth's address from her in one of your classes and you head straight to her house. Once you get there you knock on the door and you are greeted by by Elizabeth. "Hey Adam, thanks for showing up. So sorry again for earlier, come on in." She offers. "Thanks, and it's no problem really." You say as you enter. You guys start to talk and the time seems to go by quickly. Before you know it, it's six and it's getting dark outside. "Wow is it really six already? I should be heading home but it's been nice hanging out." You state. "Are you sure you have to go? Do you want something to eat before you go?" She says. While she says that you notice her eye start to twitch, or are you imagining things? "Uhm, yeah I guess something to eat wouldn't hurt." You say hesitantly. "Great, I'll grab something. She says as she gets up, however you believe her voice almost sounded robotic...You remeber what that one guy said in the hallway. After a moment of contemplation you decide to give it a try, what could it hurt? You grab them from your bag and look towards Elizabeth, what comes next you could never have seen coming...</p></b>
