	<p>Hello Player! Welcome to The Invasion You Could Never See Coming! In the next few minutes you will play as a character named Adam Humiel who is a sophmore that has just transfered to a new school called Pleasant Hill High School. The setting will be Adam's first week at Pleasant Hill High where everything seems normal at first... but it seems that something is odd with the students attending... Will you brave the dangers that will come and help solve what is going on at Pleasant Hill High?
	(Some functions of the game are not working to the best of their ability. However time restraints forced me to turn in the game as it is.)
