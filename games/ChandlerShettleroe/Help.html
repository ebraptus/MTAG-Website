			<h1>The Invasion You Could Never See Coming</h1>

	<main>
	<p><b>As you sit there you take a second to catch your breath then peek through the hedges at the house. You see the robot thing come out on the porch look around for a few seconds then walks back inside. Just then you feel a hand clasp around your mouth! You turn to see who the hand belongs to and there you see the kid that gave you the glasses. "Don't panic, keep quiet and follow me" he whispers. You nod and then start to follow him down two streets. To where you assume to be his house and into an open window where you follow. You find yourself in the basement of this house surrounded by 3 other people. "Hello, Adam. My name is Johnson, or John for short." States the boy that you followed here. "This is Monty, our shop keeper, and this is Jasmine, our class specialist." States John. "To make this quick I assume by the way you ran out of Elizabeth's place, you used the glasses and saw what she truly was. That was called a synth they look human but are actually robots that have taken the place of a human, we have been investigating these beings for some time but have not been able to do anything thus far. The glasses show what they trully are and are the only way to find a synth. That's why the synth's want them so bad, so no one will ever be able to find them." Exclaims John. "However Jasmine believes that you can be taught to take these things out and help us solve this issue. So here you are, you got all that?" Asks John. "Uhm, I think so." You answer. "Great, now talk to Jasmine to get a class then I'll give you your first task. Then talk to Monty to get some new gear." Orders John. "We have also got you some ice and bandages to get you back to full strength." John says.</p></b>
