	<p><b>You walk down stairs into the kitchen where your mom is getting her things ready. There are also a few boxes that are left that haven't been unpacked. "Did dad already leave for work?" You ask. "Yes, he had to leave early for work." Your mom answers. "Of course he did, you guys are always working. His job is why we had to move in the first place." You mutter. "Now you know that your dad needed this to keep his job. Give him some credit and try to make the best of it. Now I am heading out and you should be too." Your mom states. You grab something to eat and grab your backpack before walking out the door.</b></p>
