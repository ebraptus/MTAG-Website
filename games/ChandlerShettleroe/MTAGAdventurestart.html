	<p><b>"Adam, Adam" you hear a low deep voice call out. "Hello? Who's there?" You exclaim back. "Someone that cares about you. Now, I don't have much time, so I need to say this quickly. You will need great strength in these next few days, something is wrong around here and you are the only one to able fix it. That is all the time I have for now, now it is time for you to go." states the mysterious voice."Wait! Fix what? What is going on?" You shout back. "All will be answered soon, you must go Adam, Adam...Adam! Adam! Wake up! You are going to be late!" You are shaken awake while the low voice is drowned out by the estatic shouts of your mom. "It's time to get ready for your first day of school at Pleasant Hill High!" Exclaims your mother."Do I have to?" You groan back. "Yes, I know it's a new school, but you have to. Now, get dressed and get ready to go." Says your mother as she walks out. "Fine" you sigh as you roll out of your bed. As, you get dressed, you wonder about the odd dream that you had and decide that it was nothing.</b></p>
