	<p><b>You head out the door and start walking to school."Bye honey, hope you have a good first day of school!" Yells your mom. "Thanks, hope you have a good day at work!" You yell back. After awhile you check your phone for the time. It seems even though the rush to get out the door, you have left the house really early. So, you figure you could wander around for a bit and still make it to school on time.</b></p>
